# Sporky: Your Campus Sidekick

A Tamagotchi-inspired, on-screen buddy that keeps you safe, shaded, and hydrated at ASU Tempe.

### What Sporky Does
- Safe Route: stay near blue-light Emergency stations.
- Hydrated Route: pass fountains, bottle fillers, and refreshers.
- Shady Route: choose cooler paths with higher shade scores.
- Weather-wise tips: “103 outside, make sure to drink water.” (Tempe-aware)
- Mix & match any combo of the three routing modes.

### How It Thinks
- Base map from existing online tiles; campus overlays rendered on top.
- Routing graph weighted by your choices: safety, hydration, shade.
- Mood + speech bubbles react to heat, rain, time, and your settings.

### Privacy & Safety
- Location is optional and transparent; no continuous tracking by default.
- Not a substitute for emergency services.
